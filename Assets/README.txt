2. Develop your custom asset bundles, using the Asssembly-CSharp2 created

3. Export your asset bundles by right-clicking as before and selecting "Build Modded Asset Bundles"
  - You might need to change the script's target from `BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64` to any other, depending on the platform targeted.

4. Import the bundle into your mod!

You may delete this file, if you want.
